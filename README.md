# Hi there

Hi, my name is Martin Rohwedder. I am an App and Web developer, which currently have my eyes on technologies as 
- Next.JS (react.js), 
- Entity Framework Core
- Blazor development.
- MAUI.NET

I have previous experience in some backend developing especially with java (spring framework) and C# (MVC) as the main programming technologies, but I am focusing on becoming a fullstack developer.
