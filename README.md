# Passionate Developer

Hi, my name is Martin Rohwedder. I am a passionate developer, which creates apps, games, APIs and much more.
I am an all-around developer, though my strongest passions is with the Java and C# technologies. At the moment I am focusing mostly on technologies as:

- Spring Framework (Spring Boot & Java)
- MAUI.NET
- Flutter
- Next.JS (React and JS)

I have previous professional experience in backend developing especially with Java (spring framework) as the main programming technologies, but I am not afraid of trying other technologies, if they can solve problem faster. I am incorporating new practices in my developing projects, as containorizing with my apps with Docker.
