Hi, my name is Martin Rohwedder. I am an App and Web developer, which currently have my eyes on technologies as Flutter/dart, react.js, Entity Framework Core and Blazor development.
I have previous experience in some backend developing especially with java and C# as the main programming technologies, but I am focusing on becoming a fullstack developer. If you would like to know more, you can visit my website [http://www.martin-rohwedder.dk](http://www.martin-rohwedder.dk)
