# Hi there

Hi, my name is Martin Rohwedder. I am an App and Web developer, which currently have my eyes on technologies as 
- Flutter/dart, 
- react.js, 
- Entity Framework Core
- Blazor development.

I have previous experience in some backend developing especially with java (spring framework) and C# (MVC) as the main programming technologies, but I am focusing on becoming a fullstack developer.
